      <article>
        <p>Raising an eyebrow in the face of danger, Akshan fights evil with dashing charisma, righteous vengeance, and
          a conspicuous lack of shirts. He is highly skilled in the art of stealth combat, able to evade the eyes of his
          enemies and reappear when they least expect him. With a keen sense of justice and a legendary death-reversing
          weapon, he rights the wrongs of Runeterras many scoundrels while living by his own moral code: “Dont be an
          ass.”</p>

      <article id="abilities">
        <p>
          <b>Passive - Dirty Fighting</b>
          Every three hits from Akshans attacks and damaging abilities deal a burst of physical damage. If the target
          was a champion, Akshan also gains a mediocre shield.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q - Avengerang</b>
          Akshan throws a boomerang that deals physical damage and reveals enemies hit, extending its range each time it
          hits an enemy. Enemies can be hit once as the boomerang goes out and once as it returns.</p>
        <p><b>W - Going Rogue</b>
          Akshan becomes camouflaged for a short duration, or indefinitely while near terrain. During this time, Akshan
          can see trails leading toward Scoundrels and gains move speed and mana regeneration while moving toward them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>E - Heroic Swing</b>
          Akshan fires a hookshot that embeds in the first terrain hit. While embedded, he can recast to swing around
          the terrain in the cast direction, firing physical damage bullets at the nearest enemy while swinging. While
          swinging, he can recast again to jump off in the direction of the cursor and fire a final shot. CD refreshes
          on kills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>R - Comeuppance</b>
          Akshan locks onto an enemy champion and begins channeling power into his gun to store bullets. At the end of
          the duration or after recasting Akshan unleashes the stored bullets, each dealing physical damage based on
          missing health to the first minion, champion, or structure hit.
          Akshan can move normally and cast Heroic Swing while channeling and firing Comeuppance.
